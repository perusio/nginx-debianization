### The configuration for the status pages of php-fpm. As described in
### http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.configuration.php.

### php-fpm provides a status and a heartbeat page that is served through the web server.
### Here's an example configuration for them.


## The status page is at /fpm-status. Only local access is
## allowed. Non authorized access returns a 404 through the error_page
## directive.
location = /fpm-status {
    if ($dont_show_fpm_status) {
        return 404;
    }

    fastcgi_pass phpcgi;
}


## The ping page is at /ping and returns the string configured at the php-fpm level.
## Also only local network connections (loopback and LAN) are permitted.
location = /ping {
    if ($dont_show_fpm_status) {
        return 404;
    }

    fastcgi_pass phpcgi;
}
